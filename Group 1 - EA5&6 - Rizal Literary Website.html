        <h2><i>- Laforteza, Charles Ethan C. (2024)</i></h2>
        <img src="PHOTOS/IBARRA.png" alt="Ibarra Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Ibarra's image -->

        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2; font-size: 25px;"><strong>Crisostomo Ibarra</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Full Name: </strong> Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra y Magsalin</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Background: </strong> Ibarra is the protagonist of Noli Me Tangere. He is a young idealistic Filipino who studied in Europe and, after seven years of education, went back to the Philippines. Ibarra's father, Don Rafael was rich and influential man in his town but died as he got proved to be subversive.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Personality: </strong> Ibarra is a man of principle, very deeply committed to helping his country progress through education. Being educated in Europe, he is both rational and reform-minded. He advocates peaceful means of improving society, unlike other characters like Elias, who find more radical methods to be essential.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Role in the Story: </strong> Ibarra longs to build a school in his village to advance learning and growth. He faces an opposition force from corrupt officials and the friars, who believe education is counterproductive to their interests. His idealism slowly changes into disillusionment as he finds more injustice. He later reappears in El Filibusterismo as the revolutionary figure Simoun.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Symbolism: </strong> Ibarra is the symbol of the aspirations of the educated Filipino youth as striving for peaceful reforms which get crushed and rejected by oppression and corruption.</p>

        <br>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;"> What strikes awe in me within the character of Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra in "Noli Me Tangere" is how inspirational he is. A believer in enlightenment ideals that propagate changes, he will keep on reaching out to do reforms in the Philippine society. In my view, his deep compassion for fellowmen, especially those who are oppressed and marginalized, makes one admire this man so much because he wanted to improve their lives. Ibarra's love life takes a much-emotional dimension with his romantic affair with Maria Clara. Above all, his bravery in speaking out for justice against the unrighteous attitude of the Spanish colonizers at the risk of personal danger makes him an exceptional person. I see him as a symbol of the larger aspirations and frustrations among Filipinos that time, akin to my own so this one becomes a figure to be reckoned with in resistance and inspiration.

            </p>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;"> One of the reasons why I just adore Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra is relatable to every modern-day Filipino: His call for social reform mirrors the ongoing battles for justice and equality in society today. His time under oppression is characteristic of what takes place today, such as political and human rights issues, making his character timeless. Secondly, Ibarra's walk between tradition and modernization, coupled with his themes of love and sacrifice reflects personal and cultural dilemmas that most Filipinos face in their personal lives. In this regard, modern Filipinos continue to relate to Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra as his struggle for social reform echoes what numerous people experience in the new yester year. Those who continue experiencing this today find oppression akin to the same array of situations people are dealing with in modern times - political corruption and violation of rights. Equally, Ibarra's poise between old and new, as well as the themes of love and sacrifice, were personal and cultural struggles common to many Filipinos in their everyday lives. Also to add my favorite quote from the book itself, it went by “to me one does not correct one wrong by committing another, nor is one pardoned by useless weeping or by giving alms to the church.” Because to me it means that it cannot just be covered by doing another wrong. The lesson learned here is that feeling sorry for something is not corrected by just lamenting over it or trying to pay compensation by bestowing alms to the church as it is shallow, and nothing's actual change takes place. Correction calls for real action and reflection, which speaks of accountability and true steps towards rectification rather than something that's just verbal. <strong>(Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra Y Magsalin (Ibarra) Character Analysis in Noli Me Tangere | LitCharts, n.d.)</strong></p>
    
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;"> The acts of advocacy of Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra would, therefore, tell so much of the continuing struggle against oppression and corruption, which link him to modern Filipinos in present-day society. His struggles summed up the tension between tradition and progress; the struggles current men undergo are therefore linked with his. Through his love and sacrifices, he conveys universal themes of resilience and hope that inspire people toward pursuing necessary changes and ac-countability in life. Finally, Ibarra's character embodies both the aspirations and frustrations of the Filipino people, and more importantly, active participation in working towards a much-needed better future. Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra typified the unfortunate fate of the Filipino people in their pursuit of justice and reform as well as their identity. His fighting spirit for social transformation reflects the on-going struggle to overcome oppressive and corrupted society, which is familiar for every modern Filipino. The experiences of Ibarra underscore the tension between traditionalists and progressive elements in confrontation within similar challenges today. Through love and sacrifices, he encapsulates universal themes that represent resilience and hope; people are inspired to pursue real change and accountability in their lives. The protagonist, thus, stands for the desires and disappointments of the Filipino people, reinforcing the need for active involvement in the race for a better tomorrow.</p>

        <img src="PHOTOS/ELIAS.png" alt="Elias Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Elias's image -->

        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2; font-size: 25px;"><strong>Elias</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Full Name: </strong> Unknown (commonly known as Elias)</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Background: </strong> Elias comes from a tragic history. He is of mixed Filipino and Spanish descent whose family lost honor based on false accusations, living in abject poverty afterwards. As such, he serves as a boatman who will assist Ibarra during his voyage.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Personality: </strong> Elias is strategic and reflective. In contrast to Ibarra, he is disillusioned with the present system of society and feels that violent revolution may be the only way to bring about change in the country once and for all.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Role in the Story: </strong> Elias is the foil to Ibarra. While Ibarra is for social reform through non-violent means, Elias believes that this is a system that should be brought down. He also teaches Ibarra about the misery of the lower classes and the depth to which corruption was within the Philippines. In the end, he is willing to give his life to save Ibarra by giving up his own, which shows that he is willing to give his life for the cause of national liberation.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Symbolism: </strong> Elias symbolizes the suffering of the downtrodden Filipinos and the increasing want for revolution. As such, he represents the radical side of reform, in contrast to Ibarra.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>1.) Character Introduction: Elias</b>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;"> In Noli Me Tangere the most recognizable character for me is Elias. He is complex and is indicative of the suppressed Filipino soul of his time in the hands of the Spanish colonizers (Rizal, 2012, p. 285). As a mysterious boatman, the entourage of Elias later unraveled an accusation of Elias's deadly past-life influences that shape his revolutionary ideals (Rizal, 2012, p. 301). He intends to bring justice and equality to a society largely plagued with corruption, the abuse of power, and systemic oppression (Rizal, 2012, p. 322). Elias comes from very poor soil, yet he has profound moral convictions and an unshakeable sense of justice (Rizal, 2012, p. 335). His willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good makes him an interesting and admirable figure (Rizal, 2012, p. 353). In all, I chose Elias for his personal as well as professional life, where he personifies the courage, selflessness, and his unique vision regarding social change with which he is associated — reflective of social struggle, idealism, and the true call to fight for justice and equality on which we are still taking a stand today (Rizal, 2012, p. 363). </p>
    
        <br>

        <b>2.) Reason for Favoritism: Why Elias Stands Out</b>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">What particularly stands out in regard to Elias is his strong principles and commitment to pursuing justice at the risk of personal danger and societal adversity (Rizal, 2012, p. 308). There is a depth in his character that reveals an intricate involvement with a struggle involving right and wrong (Rizal, 2012, p. 323). Unlike most of the characters in Noli Me Tangere, Elias is neither from the privileged sector nor from a background of wealthy strains; however, he remains a significant figure in the unfolding novel narrative of revolution and social reform (Rizal, 2012, p. 341).</p>
       
        <p>There are several reasons why Elias is my favorite character:</p>

        <b>A.) Moral Integrity: </b>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias remained in several instances to be morally sound, holding things unjustly wrought against the Filipino people by the Spanish colonial regime (Rizal, 2012, p. 311). His stand had made him a beacon of morality for the other characters in the novel, most especially Crisostomo Ibarra (Rizal, 2012, p. 322). As a product of a tragic background—where the regimes wrongfully persecuted and disgraced his family—Elias did not let hatred and vengeance guide his actions (Rizal, 2012, p. 345). Instead, he pours his anger into a greater issue: he's there to fight for the dignity and rights of the commoners (Rizal, 2012, p. 350).</p>

        <b>B.) Advocate for the Oppressed: </b>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias is representative of the Filipino masses who had been subjected to the oppressive Spanish colonial government (Rizal, 2012, p. 311). He finds a voice with which he proclaims the wrongs of the poor, the oppressed, and becomes their voice heard by the system (Rizal, 2012, p. 330). What makes Elias stand out is that he sympathized with people and fought for others, not just for his own selfish gain (Rizal, 2012, p. 347). His character has communicated a sense of solidarity with the oppressed and what is right, no matter how many heavy hands stand against you (Rizal, 2012, p. 355).</p>

        <b>C.) Revolutionary Spirit: </b>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias is a call for deep change in society (Rizal, 2012, p. 315). He feels that the system is so rotten that it cannot be changed by slight reforms (Rizal, 2012, p. 342). His ideals, portrayed more in the form of macro understandings of how oppression works at the structural level, made him a progressive character who transforms (Rizal, 2012, p. 351). It is such visionary spirit that calls for modern movements challenging systemic injustices (Rizal, 2012, p. 360).</p>

        <b>D.) Selflessness and Bravery: </b>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The dangers that Elias regularly exposes himself to transform the novel because on more than one occasion he saves Ibarra's life, risking his security to protect him and attain the purposes of the reformist vision that Ibarra nurtures (Rizal, 2012, p. 327). His 'bravery' springs neither from hero-worship nor a conceit but is fueled by a deep sense of duty toward his fellow Filipinos (Rizal, 2012, p. 337). His being able to give his life for a cause of justice turns him into a tragedy, yet he is heroic (Rizal, 2012, p. 357). He epitomizes this selflessness in the interest of the greater good (Rizal, 2012, p. 364).</p>
        
        <br>

        <b>3.) Character Profile Development</b>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias’ role in Noli Me Tangere is pivotal, as he not only aids Ibarra but also challenges him to reconsider the limits of peaceful reform (Rizal, 2012, p. 312). Below are key moments in the novel that illustrate why I find Elias compelling and how his character can be connected to the present situation of the Filipino people (Rizal, 2012, p. 338).</p>

        <b>A.) Ally and Protector of Ibarra:</b>

        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Throughout the entire novel, Elias is a protector of Ibarra, saving him from dire situations time and again (Rizal, 2012, p. 327). Of course, at the cornerstone-laying ceremony for the school Ibarra had proposed to build, such an instance is brought home when Elias thwarts an assassination attempt on Ibarra (Rizal, 2012, p. 329). Such bravery defines Elias' willingness to sacrifice himself for his ideals that nothing less than education and change can make a difference for a better future of the Philippines (Rizal, 2012, p. 332).</li>
            <br>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Despite their differing thoughts as to what the future holds for social change, Elias stays committed to Ibarra. He counsels Ibarra and cautions him about potential dangers through which corrupt authorities might cause problems (Rizal, 2012, p. 336). This is a reflection of responsibility and loyalty he assumes as a moral compass for Ibarra, towards leading him on the right and just path (Rizal, 2012, p. 340).</li>
        </ul>

        <b>B.) Voice of the Oppressed:</b>

        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias is the voice of the downtrodden and oppressed Filipino people. A family who had wealth, yet shame befell them due to false accusations from certain powers, reflects in his background the sufferings that many Filipinos were subjected to under Spanish rule (Rizal, 2012, p. 342). With this personal history, Elias has deep insight into malignancies that prevail in society (Rizal, 2012, pp. 344-346).</li>
            <br>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">He is a revolutionary and also an empathetic figure fighting for the cause of others. He is the ordinary Filipino silenced by the colonial system (Rizal, 2012, p. 350). Since he knows it is the structural nature of oppression, Elias pertains to the greater fight for social justice (Rizal, 2012, pp. 358-359).</li>
        </ul>

        <b>C.) Tragic Hero:</b>

        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The most tragic and touching scenes in Noli Me Tangere is the death of Elias. Indeed, he tried to help Ibarra flee the Guardia Civil and this attempt at rescue badly wounded him and cause his death (Rizal, 2012, pp. 440-441). His last appeal to Ibarra to remember the sufferings of the Filipino people and continue to fight for freedom underscores his deep commitment to the cause of justice even in his last moments (Rizal, 2012, p. 444). Just before he dies, the last breath of Elias: "I die without seeing the dawn brighten over my native land! You who will see it, welcome it—and forget not those who have fallen during the night!" (Rizal, 2012, p. 445). This is his sacrifice and yet hope for a brighter future for the Philippines as he knows he won't be around to live in it. His death means more than any other thing-the martyrdom of the freedom fighter and a crusader of justice, thus a powerful symbol against oppression.</li>
            <br>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias' tragic death symbolizes the sacrifice of such a one fighting against oppression that later gets crushed by the system (Rizal, 2012, p. 446). His death reminds everybody of the cost of standing up for something but inspires hopes that people will carry this struggle forward (Rizal, 2012, p. 447).</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <b>Connection to the Present Situation of the Filipino People:</b>

        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias' character in Noli Me Tangere can be compared to the contemporary reality of the Filipino, more so on the subject of social justice issues, corruption, and inequality (Rizal, 2012, pp. 342-346). Most of the issues that Elias fought for remain relevant even today as the Filipino struggles with systemic issues, much like the abuses portrayed by the colonial, are found in the work of Rizal (Rizal, 2012, p. 359).</li>
        </ul>

        <b>A.) Fight Against Corruption:</b>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Many Filipinos today stand up against corruption in the government and other institutions as Elias stood up against the rotten, corrupt colonial government (Rizal, 2012, pp. 344-346). Corruption within the Philippines remains one of the main things that have not really enabled the country to move forward since everything has become affected-from public service down to the justice system (Rizal, 2012, p. 359). Criticisms by Elias against the Spanish government ring relevant in cries today for transparency, accountability, and a stop to corrupt practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>B.) Advocacy for the Marginalized:</b>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias' call to the poor and marginalized would find a parallel in the lives of depressed communities in the Philippines today (Rizal, 2012, p. 342). These include poverty, absence of education, and disputes regarding land. Like Elias, their voices would be amplified by activists and social movements that were said to have cried out for reform in the face of inequality and the desire for others to be given their voice when no one else would have their interests (Rizal, 2012, p. 350).</li>
        </ul>

        <b>C.) Calls for Change:</b>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias' belief for the change carries the human sentiment of most modern movements (Rizal, 2012, pp. 356-358). This is because it reminds society that basic issues have to be taken more seriously to make meaningful progress. Elias' advocacy reminds the public that changing what has been in existence for a long time would require sustained efforts towards finding a just and fair society (Rizal, 2012, p. 359).</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <b>4.) Conclusion</b>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;"> In a word, he is a character whose importance transcends Noli Me Tangere. As a revolutionary, a protector, and a voice for the oppressed, he becomes a timeless figure, embodying the crusade for justice and equality (Rizal, 2012, pp. 342-346). Elias' character, in this manner, mirrors the continuous struggle of the Filipino people throughout its history, focusing particularly on their struggle against corruption, inequality, and oppression (Rizal, 2012, p. 359). But this belief in systemic reform and the complete surrender for the greater good makes him such a very important symbol of hope and strength (Rizal, 2012, pp. 358-360). His tragic fate brings to mind how the fighting for justice comes at a cost, yet his legacy lives on as an inspiration to future generations to continue the fight for a just and even more equitable society (Rizal, 2012, pp. 444-445). Through the character of Elias, I gained a deeper appreciation for the social issues that still greatly affect the Philippines today and was reminded how important it is sometimes to fight for what is right and cost a lot (Rizal, 2012, p. 446).</p>

        <h2><i>- Pascual, Jeoffry Lanz I. (2024)</i></h2>
        <img src="PHOTOS/SISA.png" alt="Sisa Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Sisa's image -->

        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2; font-size: 25px;"><strong>Sisa</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Full Name: </strong> Narcisa</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Background: </strong> Sisa is a very poor, doting mother of two sons, Basilio and Crispin. Her husband neglects them, beats them, and forsakes the family making Sisa to fend for herself and her children alone. She attempts to be as great as her expectation for her children, but she remains powerless against the will of the powerful authorities in the town.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Personality: </strong> Sisa is kind, soft and gentle, and deeply devoted to her children. She is a tragic figure whose love and devotion for her sons send her into madness when they are taken away from her. She starts to gradually deteriorate to the sanity of complete insanity as a reflection of her inability to fight the injustices that go on around her.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Role in the Story: </strong> Sisa is a personification of suffering mass among the Filipinos, who are, most particularly, the women. Her story involves one of heartbreak and loss because throughout the novel, she searches for her sons, eventually losing them; her realization drives her mad. Her death in Noli Me Tangere brought a poignant mention as she symbolizes what results from destructive corruption and abuse-destruction of innocence and purity.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Symbolism: </strong> Sisa is the suffering motherland, representing children victimized by oppressive forces. Madness then symbolizes the trauma and helplessness of Filipinos under the yoke of Spanish rule.</p>

        <br>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Dr. Rizal’s novel Noli Me Tangere offered a diverse range of characters, each represents the different social conditions and struggles of Filipinos in the real world during the Spanish colonial period. Ever since Junior High School where Noli Me Tangere was first taught and up until now, my favorite character has never changed. She is none other than Sisa, the mother of Crispin and Basilio. I am deeply fond of Sisa because she is a mother that shows unconditional love to her children, just as my mother to me and my younger brother. There are three reasons to why Sisa is my favorite character in Noli Me Tangere. First, as I stated earlier, is her unwavering love for her sons. Second, is Sisa’s resilience all throughout her tough life. This resilience is clearly noticeable on how she endured her abusive husband, Pedro. Third and lastly, Sisa represents the oppressed and the neglected members of the community.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">I vividly recall my junior high school days because the story of Sisa in Noli Me Tangere had left an unforgettable mark in my life. The pain Sisa suffered, as I remember particularly in Chapter XVI, titled “Sisa”, where her son Crispín was wrongly accused of stealing and disappeared (Rizal, 1912). Then Basilio fled their home because he was being hunted by the civil guards, leading to her descent into madness.  The events that happened to Sisa’s life during these chapters portrayed the grim reality of life during those oppressive times. The poor were the victims of a never-ending saga of oppression and abuse by those who have. On the other hand, I recall that in Chapter XXI: “The Story of a Mother,” Sisa’s descent into madness shows how deeply rooted her suffering affected her. As she walks the streets, crying out for her lost sons, Crispin and Basilio (Rizal, 1912).</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Her situation affects her not only emotionally but also mentally. The chapter showed what kind of monsters the ill-minded oppressors were. It also helps us to understand the sacrifices mothers make and how families suffer from a society that does not protect them. Her struggle shows the theme of injustice and helplessness that Rizal wanted to convey, making her the symbol of a mother’s love and loss. I deeply appreciate Sisa’s character arc, as she epitomizes our “Inang Bayan,” the motherland, which has long endured tyrannical rule at the hands of those in power during those times. Her story emits a sense of empathy and emphasizes being resilient in confronting and overcoming inequalities.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The story of Sisa in Noli Me Tangere parallels the constant issues that most Filipinos face during her time and up to today, especially when discussing mental health issues related to poverty and systemic injustices. Many silently undergo emotional torture because of economic issues, including hunger and poor living conditions. Help is not pursued, due to shame or stigma attached to mental health. Therefore, this also puts forward Sisa's fading into madness as portraying the psychologically crushing burden that systemic injustice imposes on a family. Sisa's decline into madness shows how much pain systemic injustice causes families. The false accusations against Crispin highlight modern issues where unfair treatment and discrimination from ruling classes can lead to serious problems for marginalized people and communities. Just like Sisa, many today suffer from the effects of unjust systems that harm their mental health and well-being. Her story comes out as one that brings this crucial need for social support systems in our society that bring forth both mental health and socio-economic inequalities.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">To conclude, I give my flowers to Dr. Rizal for giving us a well-constructed character story that captivates us today. Sisa's character in Noli Me Tangere serves as a sentimental reflection of the Filipino people's hard-fought struggles under Spanish colonial rule.  Her love for her sons, despite the ups and downs and hardships in life, was unmatched. Her fall into madness was devastating. In addition, it manifests the repressive situation and institutionalized inequalities of the Filipino society during the times of Rizal. The story of Sisa is relevant to the modern-day Filipinos, most especially with the persistent challenges on mental health, poverty, and discrimination. Thus, through this character, Rizal was able to pass on the devastating effects of colonial oppression upon people and families, to incite readers to think of suffering by the wretched, and to work towards the coming of a better and more just and reasonable society. The indelible mark that Sisa has had on her good motherly stature, power, and the toll upon humankind due to injustice continues to inspire and challenge us to face the persisting issues affecting Filipino communities. To honor Sisa’s character, we should always be reminded of the importance of empathy and effective action in addressing injustices. Let us carry forward her everlasting legacy by advocating a society that supports the vulnerable and champions virtues, compassion and equity.</p>

        <h1 id="basilio">3.4 Basilio: A Journey of Resilience, Education, and Hope Amid Hardship</h1>
        <h2> - Santiago, Vergel Adrian G. (2024)</h2>
        <img src="BASILIO.png" alt="Basilio Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Basilio's image -->

        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2; font-size: 25px;"><strong>Basilio</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Full Name: </strong> Basilio. Surname is unknown.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Background: </strong> Basilio is one of Sisa's sons. He and his little brother Crispin are sacristans in town church. However, these are taken advantage of by their church officials, falsely accusing them of stealing Basilio survived the injustice that befell his family but scathingly scarred by such trauma.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Personality: </strong> Basilio is an intelligent and industrious outgrowth of the ruggedness of his young life. Though tragedy has it that befalls his family, he is able to muster inner strength to continue education.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Role in the Story: </strong> In Noli Me Tangere, Basilio is a minor character; however, his role in the story is increased in the second novel, El Filibusterismo. After the death of his mother, he actually buries her with the help of Elias; this is the turning point of his life. Later, he becomes an emblem of the educated youth, akin to Ibarra but also possesses a more personal feeling of the pain suffered by the masses.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left; line-height: 2;"><strong>Symbolism: </strong> Basilio-as the hope for the bright Philippines. His desire for education and survival manifests the hopes held for meaningful change through a new generation.</p>

        <br>

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">I like Basilio from Noli Me Tangere most because he stays strong all throughout the hardship in life as a boy and son of a sorrowful mother, Sisa; moreover, who suffers too much at a young age but uses difficulties as motivation to build a better tomorrow (Rizal, 2012, pp. 343-344). Such silent confidence and a solid willingness to do something must inspire others, and his growth story implies hope in everyone’s hardship. The person for which the company would most benefit from is Basilio in my opinion due to his resolute determination (Rizal, 2012, p. 344). No matter that he was deprived of his family and saw the other side of Spanish colonization, he is not drowned in hopelessness (Rizal, 2012, p. 345). However, Basilio does not try to struggle his way up to be a better person; he tries to make his way through education and learning (Rizal, 2012, p. 346). The journey he takes from lamb’s pies and football into a man fighting for his small piece of the success pie is heartwarming, especially because he refuses to allow his suffering to define him (Rizal, 2012, pp. 344-345). These personal traits, love for self-improvement, and silent strength make him my favorite character (Rizal, 2012, p. 345).</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In Noli Me Tangere, it is the death of his mother, Sisa, who dies in the hands of her son, which makes Basilio very much in pain with no constraints (Rizal, 2012, pp. 440-442). This moment is one of the most pathetic scenes in the novel and the episode describes Basilio to the letter. Instead of wallowing in anger or self-pity, Basilio commits to learning: an amazing example of his strength and perseverance (Rizal, 2012, pp. 444-445). In one way or another, these experiences of Basilio are reflected in the present state of the Filipino people (Rizal, 2012, p. 446).</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The problem is many aspects of Philippine society still today have their roots in bondage and serfdom: slavery does not disappear simply by elevating it to a higher category of dependency (Rizal, 2012, p. 447). The same way that Basilio believed education was the key to escape from ignorance, many others believe to lift themselves out of poverty and have a successful life, one must get educated (Rizal, 2012, pp. 444-445). The silence yet determination from Basilio reflects the modern Pinoy struggling to make sense of their chaotic world, and Isagani, hope in mushy mud (Rizal, 2012, p. 448). Such enduring hope—Basilio teaches us that being hopeful even though he has lost much is what makes a Filipino hold on (Rizal, 2012, pp. 445-446). Some 150 years after Basilio walked from town to learn in the Filipino resistance, his quest to conquer adversity and make himself through scholarship resonates amid fights for egalitarianism and justice that remain stubborn in society (Rizal, 2012, p. 447).</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Like the rest of our oppressed yet living peoples, his character shows us that no matter what you have gone through, it may never be too late to change. Basilio is hope, determination, and, most especially, the power of education or the notion that policy can indeed change (Rizal, 2012, p. 448). From the sorrowful start to a story of transformation rest the claims of Filipino people’s resilience as they grapple with social and economic issues in the struggle to make life better (Rizal, 2012, p. 449). The importance of Basilio is for motivation and purpose to keep moving forward to bring about change, just like the Filipinos are trying to pull themselves up today right from the dregs of society (Rizal, 2012, p. 450).</p>

        <h2 id="ibarra-fanfics">4.1 Ibarra’s Dream: The Struggle for Reform Then and Now</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><i>- Laforteza, Charles Ethan C. (2024)</i></h3>
        <img src="PHOTOS/IBARRA.png" alt="Ibarra Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Ibarra's image -->

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Behind the Manila skyline, the sun set golden, but its rays failed to brighten up the mess that stood before him. Across the busy streets the youth, with his crisp white shirt and under his arm the thick book, hurried toward the university gates. He was Ibarra, but not the Ibarra of the thesis, for he was fresh from the world's practical school, a young fighting adherent, animated with that fire in his soul. Yet, as in the case of the original Ibarra, he was also confronted daily with a question that haunted him: Is it ever possible to really reform, or is the system too bent out of shape to be mended?</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">As he entered the university grounds, he felt a surge of determination. He had read Noli Me Tangere so many times by Rizal, only drawn back again and again to the character who bore his name—a man who came back into the country full of idealism and went on to face reality head-on, full of the gore and dysentery of corruption and oppression. In Ibarra's mind, it was disturbingly similar to the struggles he saw around him. Have we really come so far since Rizal, he thought to himself.</p>

        <h3 id="ibarras-legacy">4.1.1 Ibarra’s Legacy: A Vision of Progress</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Crisostomo Ibarra, in the novel Noli Me Tangere, signifies hope, progress, and the hope of peaceful reform. He had spent some years abroad in Europe and was now bent upon returning to his native land to work for his country's improvement. He believed that education was the medicine to cure the ills of his people, and he had planned an institution that would provide education to generations so that they might be freed from ignorance and colonial shackles.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">But when he is brought face to face with the core of deep-rooted corruption within the colonial government and the Catholic Church, optimism about Ibarra cracks at its core. His idealism is crushed by the cruel truth of the oppressive system and the resistance that he is going to face while attempting reform. Hence, it is not long that Ibarra is branded a traitor, and his dream of peaceful reform lies in ruin.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Reformers in today's world are the same problems Ibarra solved a century ago. They start with the conviction that improvement comes through education, law, and dialogue. They battle for the upliftment of the quality of life of the Filipinos through reform in education, health care, governance, and human rights. But again, like Ibarra, many would be derailed by the obstacles created by corruption, political greed, and the web of entrenched interests who want power over progress.</p>
        
        <h3 id="idealist-dilemma">4.1.2 The Idealist’s Dilemma: Reform or Revolution?</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">As Ibarra walked through the hallowed halls of the university, he heard students debating recent protests. Some merely argued that peaceful protests accomplished nothing and radical action was needed to destroy a corrupt system. Others insisted that dialogue, though slow, and reform were the only ways to true progress.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Ibarra listened, and the inner conflict that had rent him asunder all these years flared up within. Like Ibarra, in Rizal's Noli Me Tangere, the decision was to be taken between two opposing worlds of moral philosophy. When, after witnessing the brutality of the authorities, his window of possibility was lost to reform from within, Ibarra himself teetered on the brink of relinquishing his peacemaking ideals. By the time El Filibusterismo opens, Ibarra has become Simoun, the man who is willing to use force and revolution to bring his changes into society.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">This stage of reformer to revolution typified the disgruntlements of those who deem the then-existing system irredeemable. For today, in this age, many young Filipinos, if not all the students of the university, are questioning themselves whether peaceful reform is enough or only drastic means can bring about actual change. This debate rings up to this very day as many political debates, activism, and social movements carried the same theme.</p>

        <h3 id="ibarras-relevance">4.1.3 Ibarra’s Relevance: Hope Amidst Struggle</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Ibarra's story is pertinent to today's Filipino because, although the tides of history may have changed, the issues he fought for himself remain: inequality, corruption, and injustice. The desire to make his country better for his children takes flight, but the failure inspires a lesson about why reformers, who want change in their institutions, fail in their pursuit.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Today, Ibarra could be a young politician campaigning for and participating in educational reform, or an NGO worker pushing for the access of healthcare in various rural communities, or a student activist for higher government transparency. Be that as it may, whatever form he will take, the dream of Ibarra lives on in every Filipino who has the hope that positive change is indeed possible despite the seeming impossibilities blocking his way.</p>
        
        <h3 id="learning-from-ibarra">4.1.4 Reflection: Learning from Ibarra’s Journey</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Thus, sitting in his dorm the evening after, thumbing through the pages of Noli Me Tangere, the modern Ibarra could not help but muse about the legacy of the character he shared a name with. Hope and tragedy seemed to mark the story of Ibarra—a man who believed in the power of education and reform but, in the end, was victimized by the very oppressive forces he wanted to alter.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Yet, mulling over Rizal's Ibarra made the young man understand that, although the path of peace reforming was one of great difficulty and brought its maker to the graveside many times, it was something that should be undertaken. This is because Ibarra's dream of a greater Philippines based on education, compassion, and equality is true and valid. No matter how tough the fight is, as every generation of Filipinos has to reenact, which Ibarra did more than a century back.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">For the modern Filipino, the story of Ibarra is both inspiring and reminding. This is his lesson: although the road toward progress is littered with setbacks, idealism should not be laid down. The struggle for justice and reform is long and difficult, but it is a fight worth continuing. So long as there are Filipinos dreaming of a better society, Ibarra's vision of progress will never really fade.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">With his new aim, he closed the book and knew that like the character whom he admired, he would continue fighting for the dream of a just and better Philippines.</p>

        <h3 id="ibarra-conclusion">4.1.5 Conclusion: The Enduring Impact of Ibarra’s Dream</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Indeed, it can be said that the effects of Crisostomo Ibarra still linger within the Filipino minds who adhere to education, peaceful reform, and the chance of progress. The idealism to disillusion is the reflection of the challenges that reformers face, both in the past and the present.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Through Ibarra's story, Rizal calls for us to think of our society and ask ourselves whether or not we do enough to foster a meaningful change. The dream of Ibarra lives in those who strive for justice and equality. Sometimes, however, we forget that while the road to reform may be sometimes so hard, it is indeed a road worth traveling.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Ibarra is, for me, an epitome of hope for a nation: that no matter how cracked up things would be in this really dysfunctional country, if people desire change and are willing to fight for it, then any possibility is open, including that things might get better.</p>

        <h2 id="elias-fanfics">4.2 Elias: The Revolutionary Spirit of the Filipino People</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><i>- Alaman, Dodgie Mar U. (2024)</i></h3>
        <img src="PHOTOS/ELIAS.png" alt="Elias Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Elias's image -->

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">It was a still evening, very quiet, and far away from the roar and madness of the city. In a small barangay between mountains, a group of young men and women all gathered around a fire lit up their faces. They were not here for play. They were here to talk about injustice. Especially, one of them was a young man who had been in his early twenties, with fiery passion in his eyes that has shown him to be very intent on making his voice heard. And his name was Elias—and though it would go by several centuries since Rizal's original Elias would roam the rivers and forests of the Philippines, in spirit, the fire was far from being doused.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The discussion was about the growing gap between the rich and the poor, the abuses of those in positions of power, and a cycle of poverty that seemed to consume their town with no end in sight. Elias had heard enough. Standing up on his feet, he spoke with the conviction of a man who knew well that words alone are not enough to change his people's fate.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">We have tried to wait. We have tried to ask. But how long do we wait for ourselves to be silenced by the promise of reforms that never come? Low, yet frantic. "Our ancestors fought for freedom. It's time we do the same.".</p>

        <h3 id="elias-flame">4.2.1 Elias: The Revolutionary Flame</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In Jose Rizal’s Noli Me Tangere, Elias is the radical part of the Filipino spirit-the one who, in order to attain justice, would go that extra mile and, consequently, give his life away. Not like Crisostomo Ibarra, who believed in 'peaceful reform', Elias was more of a pragmatist. He knew that the system was rotten and that the abuses heaped by the Spanish colonial government could never be redressed through diplomacy. He did not dream of working within the system to change it but of tearing it down.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The life of Elias moves with tragedy and sacrifice. He had witnessed the suffering of his fellow Filipinos under the hands of their rulers and unjustly punished by their oligarchs. His family was wronged to him, and he was now a fugitive running from one place to another. Yet Eli did not allow himself to spend the rest of his life in hate for a personal revenge but dedicated himself instead to the liberation of his people.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias may indeed be the voice of the marginalized and oppressed in modern-day Philippines-the one who is so tired of empty promises of those in power. He can be the farmer fighting for land rights, the activist fighting against political corruption, or the worker demanding fair wages and conditions. Elias is one who has been pushed to the edge, those who feel that peaceful means are no longer enough to secure their freedom and dignity.</p>

        <h3 id="elias-modern">4.2.2 The Struggles of Today: Elias in Modern Times</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">It was as Elias continued by the fire to talk of his mind that his listeners were all the more rapt with attention. The ills he brought up were no new thing. All were the same things that had been afflicting the country for many generations. Just as Elias in Noli Me Tangere believed violence might be the only answer, so did some of the barangay's young feel the same way. There was little hope for them in the future promised by the government decades ago to end this systemic neglect and injustice.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias would be the symbol today of everyone who believes that radical action is necessary. He typifies how a society becomes frustrated, seeing too many attempts at reform fail. It is the idealization of people after years of being ignored or abused, who now feel they must turn to revolution to bring meaningful change into reality.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In the Philippines, this revolutionary spirit lives and flourishes in different guises: the defense of ancestral domains by the indigenous peoples, resistance among environmentalists against corporate plunder of natural resources, and human rights defenders standing in opposition to extra-judicial killings. Such courage and willingness to sacrifice everything for one's ideals stay in the hearts and minds of those who believe that only with bold action sometimes bordering danger, will the real change be realized.</p>

        <h3 id="elias-sacrifice">4.2.3 The Sacrifice: A Price for Freedom</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Thus, the story of Elias is that of sacrifice. He finally gives his life to save Ibarra, the man whose peaceful ideals he had once doubted. The great message that thus lies behind is that Elias might not have believed in the methods Ibarra promoted, but he respected the cause for which both men fought. He, however, saw in Ibarra a hope for a future when his people would be free from oppression, even if Elias himself were not destined to see this future.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">One thing modern-day Filipinos may learn from Elias is how a person can lay down his life for the cause of freedom. Reminding people that just the fight towards justice may come through sacrifice, Elias's story is a reminder to contemporary society on how they must fight for freedom. Contemporary society, which has many activists, journalists and community organizers who sacrificed or could have compromised safety in order to reveal truth, serve justice, and achieve equality, are all reminders to be able to fight for freedom because of Elias's story.</p>
        
        <h3 id="elias-legacy">4.2.4 Elias’s Legacy: The Call for Justice</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">As the flames died, and the night drew colder, Elias's words seemed to stay in the minds of those who gathered there. His passion, his anger, and his readiness for battle were catching fire among the people, but what really hit them was not only the call for revolution, but his message of pure justice. This by the way is fallacious in as much as Elias was not after violence per se, but a society wherein his people can live in dignity, with the bonds of oppression finally broken open.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias lives on in every Filipino who refuses the status quo, in those who demand accountability from their leaders, in those who stood up for the rights of the margins, in those fighting against the wholesale exploitation of his people and the land he loved. He represents that radical desire for change that burns within the hearts of those who believe that justice is worth any price.</p>

        <h3 id="elias-reflection">4.2.5 Reflection: Elias and the Filipino People’s Fight for Freedom</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">As he is the embodiment of the revolutionary spirit, through which Elias lives in the minds of the Filipino people. Elias is not just a character from a novel; Elias is the reflection of a very powerful spirit that has long existed within the Philippines. From the Katipunan's fight against independence up to the movements today toward the righting of society's wrongs, through Elias, much of the Philippines remains inspired for a better future through extreme change.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Where inequality, corruption, and injustice still prevail in the country, Elias's message remains as relevant today as it was then. Indeed, his story challenges us to ask what kind of change we are looking for in our country and what length we are willing to go to make it happen. Perhaps some would choose the road of peaceful reform; others, though-not Elias alone-will know that at times the fight for freedom takes on the form of the occasion when one is made to tear down what oppresses her.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">At its core, though, is a story of hope. He believed in a future where his people could finally be free-even in their darkest moments and, ironically, when giving up his own life, that makes the story of Elias a timeless icon of the Filipino people's battle for liberation.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Being Elias, every Filipino for whom there is hope for tomorrow-the more so if such a tomorrow must be paid for dearly-walks with freedom.</p>

        <h3 id="elias-conclusion">4.2.6 Conclusion: The Undying Spirit of Elias</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias is one of the most powerful symbols of resistance and revolution for Filipinos. His story remains relevant among people who think that fighting for the right sense of justice does not have to be said by the mouth but rather accomplished through actions and sacrifices and dedication to freedom.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Elias's impact is felt in all the movements that will eventually try to challenge corruption, inequality, and oppression in the Philippines. His call for justice still stands tall inside the hearts of each Filipino, reminding all of the length and arduous nature of the road to freedom but, of course, worth the journey.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">So long as there are those who will fight for a just society, the legacy of Elias will never die.</p>

        <h2 id="sisa-fanfics">4.3 Sisa: The Broken Spirit of a Mother and the Cry of a Nation</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><i>- Pascual, Jeoffry Lanz I. </i></h3>
        <img src="PHOTOS/SISA.png" alt="Sisa Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Sisa's image -->

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">It was a very quiet evening in a small barangay. The rustling of trees from the gentle cool breeze. A mother sits inside a humble home by the doorway, her hands calloused from years of labor, tired eyes but full of love as she watches the children play. That is where I met my heroine, Sisa. Though she lived centuries after the tragic Sisa from Rizal's Noli Me Tangere, the pain in her heart felt eerily familiar: a deep, aching wound that never fully healed. She had spent most of her life in quiet suffering, giving everything for her children, but the world around her had always been cruel and impervious.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The story of Sisa is not just the story of one woman. It is a story of many Filipinas, mothers, and daughters, who all experienced suffering, injustice, and loss of loved ones. It is a story of a nation torn from the very fabric that bound it together, trying to heal its open wounds. As she gazed at her children, Sisa remembered the original Sisa in Noli Me Tangere whose madness was born from grief and suffering. Could her fate have been otherwise?</p>

        <h3 id="sisa-suffering">4.3.1 Sisa: The Face of Suffering in Colonial Philippines</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Sisa is the quintessence of suffering under the Spanish colonial regime, as expressed in Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere. Here is a woman who seemingly is poor, but with all her heart, a loving mother. She tries everything to take care of her two sons, Basilio and Crispin, who are much troubled by their abusive father as well as crushing poverty surrounding them. The whole world of Sisa collapses when both of her sons are falsely accused of having a stolen item by the corrupt sacristan mayor, where Crispin dies under the said accusations. The quest of Sisa for her children and descent into madness is a powerful symbol of a lost, abused, and forgotten nation.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Sisa's story resonates strongly within the heart of Filipinos since she embodies the oppressed and marginalized, particularly mothers and women left behind to bear societal injustices. Therefore, it cannot be said that her madness is a personal tragedy but a more general expression of the suffering of a people under cruelty and injustice. The picture of Sisa drifting in confusion, calling out for her lost sons, remains one of the hauntingest symbols in Filipino literature-the cries echoing the pain of a long-in-greed country.</p>

        <h3 id="sisa-symbol">4.3.2 The Enduring Symbol: Sisa in Modern Society</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Today, in this new Philippines, Sisa's story resonates not only to those relegated to the margins but to everyone else. She is the millions of mothers who, down the years, have seen their children ravished by violence, poverty, and exploitation. Her spirit pulsates through the families of extrajudicial killings, the mothers of missing activists, and women fighting each day to hold on as society turns away with impassivity to their anguish.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Like the original Sisa, many of today's mothers appear to be stuck in this vicious cycle of despair where their voices are lost to the ears of the powerful. They stand oftentimes at the head of inequality's line, yet their suffering falls on deaf ears. Sisa's story reminds all of the silent suffering of women, especially those living in poverty or caught in a crossfire of political and social unrest.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">While Sisa roamed the forests in Noli Me Tangere in search of her children, in this modern age, mothers scour the horizon for justice and a better future for their families. For a practical purpose, Sisa is the face of every Filipina mother left behind, abandoned by a society that failed to protect and uplift her.</p>

        <h3 id="sisa-madness">4.3.3 Sisa’s Madness: A Reflection of Society’s Neglect</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">But one of the most tragic aspects of Sisa's story is in how systematically she comes down into a madness. What is not simplistic personal loss for her, but rather symbolizes the greater madness of a system that allows such suffering to be perpetrated. Her breakdown is directly of the result of the corruption, injustice and lack of empathy in the colonial system—a system wherein there would be paid ample servants of criminals and wrongdoers ruling over the weak and oppressing the poor.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In the world today, Sisa's madness does really depict the general societal orientation that holds it proper to neglect and ignore the most vulnerable of its population. The denial of adequate health care, access to education, and equal administration of justice among the poor epitomizes the same negligence that led to the tragic case of Sisa. Her madness is a warning—a reminder that a society which ignores the cries of its people will only assure losing more lives, more suffering, and stronger broken spirits.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Sisa's falling into lunacy also typifies the way repression breaks down the human spirit. Taken to the limits, when they are deprived of justice and dignity and even the primary rights to live peacefully-they, just like Sisa could collapse in hopelessness. Her madness is a reflection of the greater madness afflicting any society which failed to take care of its people.</p>

        <h3 id="sisa-justice">4.3.4 Sisa’s Legacy: A Cry for Justice</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The tragic story of Sisa leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of the Filipino people. She is more than just a character from Rizal’s novel; she is a symbol of the oppressed, forgotten, and marginalized. Her story serves as a reminder that the fight for justice and equality is not just about grand political reforms but also about addressing the quiet, often unseen, suffering of those who have been left behind.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In the Philippines today, there are many who still live in the shadows of society—those whose struggles go unnoticed, whose pain is not recognized. Sisa’s story calls on us to remember them, to listen to their cries, and to work towards a society where no one is left to suffer in silence.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">As we reflect on Sisa’s life, we are reminded of the countless women who continue to bear the weight of injustice on their shoulders. Her story is a call to action—a reminder that until the most vulnerable among us are cared for and protected, we have not truly achieved freedom or justice.</p>

        <h3 id="sisa-reflection">4.3.5 Reflection: The Strength of Sisa’s Spirit</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">As such, while Sisa's story is one of madness and loss, it is also the story of resilience. While everything she faced and remained ignorant of about the whereabouts of her boys did not crush her, she still clung on to the slender hope that they may still live. It speaks for the strength of the Filipino spirit: undying love and perseverance in the face of unimaginable suffering.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Today, Sisa lives on in the thousands of hardworking Filipinas who fight for their families, no matter what situation the situation throws at them-from a mother struggling to finish an education to give her children the necessities of life to a grandmother babysitting for her grandchildren while both parents are abroad to an activist fighting for human rights- Sisa's spirit of resilience and love live on.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">That reminds us of all that, in the darkness there is the strength of a mother's love, in this love, hope for the ends of sufferings, the true justice to be served and for generations yet to be born, live in a world no one ever has to endure pains similar to Sisa's.</p>

        <h3 id="sisa-conclusion">4.3.6 Conclusion: Sisa’s Cry for a Better Tomorrow</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">More than the tragic figure in Rizal's Noli Me Tangere, however, Sisa is a symbol of the power of suffering of the Filipino people, especially the women and mothers, that happened under colonial rule and even long after. And this is why the truth of her story continues to resonate in many hearts today because it symbolizes never-ending struggle by the downtrodden people, left in obscurity.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">But Sisa's legacy is also that of strength and perseverance. She showed that despite all the cruelty that was heaped upon her, love for her children never vanished; her spirit never yielded. That we remember Sisa means to motivate us in reviewing the injustices of our society today and striving for a future wherein no single person shall be left behind, wherein the cries of the most vulnerable are heard, and wherein justice and equality will actually prevail.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The cry of Sisa is a call for every one of us to listen, care, and fight for a better future.</p>

        <h2 id="basilio-fanfics">4.4 Basilio: The Journey from Innocence to Revolution</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><i>- Santiago, Vergel Adrian G. </i></h3>
        <img src="PHOTOS/BASILIO.png" alt="Basilio Image"> <!-- Placeholder for Basilio's image -->

        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">A young man sits over a table in a quiet, dimly lit room in Manila, fanning through a book. Days have passed, and he had toiled-he had to be at once a student and laborer. His face may tell tales of sleepless nights and interminable long days, but his eyes are sharper, focused, and tenacious. He was Basilio—and although the world has moved mountains and seas since the time of Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, the struggle he led was essentially the same.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The story of Basilio is really perseverance in the face of adversity, reminding people of the struggles that various Filipinos have to undergo as they rise above the limitations imposed on them by their surroundings. His story-one of loss, sacrifice, and resilience-continues to inspire today's youth who face challenges in education, inequality, and searching for justice.</p>

        <h3 id="basilio-beginnings">4.4.1 Basilio’s Tragic Beginnings: The Loss of Innocence</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In Noli Me Tangere, Basilio is first presented as a young lad who lives harmoniously with his mother, Sisa, and little brother, Crispin. He actually stopped peacefully living when Crispin was taken as a thief by the corrupt sacristan who eventually became the mayor, while Sisa went mad. Basilio, still barely a child, was left to fend for himself; he runs for the police and sees his mother, mentally broken, and ultimately mourns her tragic end.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">This loss of innocence forms the center of Basilio's personality. His childhood is stolen from him, and the world is forced upon him cruel and unjust when he's still young. His mother dies, after desperate searching for her children. And upon burying Sisa alone, in the forest, the only comer to assist him was this strange, stranger Elias. From then on, Basilio is no longer a mere boy. He has witnessed all the worst that this world can give but continues his fight for a greater tomorrow.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">There's so much to Basil's story that really gets deep into the hearts of so many Filipinos-whether they were exposed to early adversities or otherwise. His loss of innocence characterizes so many children in the Philippines: they are made to grow up too fast-they either work early, lose parents through violence and poverty, or get treated very unfairly by the world with little protection and guidance.</p>

        <h3 id="basilio-education">4.4.2 The Struggle for Education: Basilio’s Path to Redemption</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Since Basilio grows older, his journey becomes a survival and education journey for him. In El Filibusterismo, Basilio emerges as one of the few young men who have escaped the shackles of poverty through education. With so many against him-the oppressive colonial system and the loss experienced by him-Basilio was set on becoming a doctor.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">For most Filipinos, the pursuit of education by Basilio symbolizes hope for a better tomorrow. Education has already become the way out of poverty and oppression; therefore, the story of Basilio is bound to touch everybody with agony that students endure in fighting for their dreams. He studies hard at night and finds work during the day, sacrificing health and well-being for the sake of pursuing one's studies.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">But it is not a story of personal ambition alone. It forms a part of greater socialistic struggle. As part of his education process, Basilio begins to realize that there were systemic corruption and exploitation of the worst kind in Philippine society. He has questions for himself about whether education alone was enough to bring about such great change and gets involved in Simoun's machinations towards the revolution against the Spanish regime.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In this way, the story of Basilio mirrors the tension between reform and revolution, a drama that runs throughout the works of Rizal. Whereas Basilio begins believing education and personal success will bring about change, he finally learns that suffering under a colonial system's injustice runs deeper than individual triumph alone can overcome. This interior conflict is the need that resonates among the youth in that country, who not only want to better their lives but also transform general issues of inequality and corruption in the country.</p>

        <h3 id="basilio-modern">4.4.3 Basilio in Modern Times: The Filipino Youth’s Fight for a Better Future</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">In today's Philippines, Basilio's story is more urgently relevant than ever. He stands for thousands of Filipino students working hard to finish their education in difficult circumstances: the very poor ones, the ones juggling work and studies, and those fighting against a system that often seems stacked against them.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Basilio is the kind of fellow that most young Filipinos aspire to. Against almost insurmountable odds, Basilio never gave up hope. He applied himself and listened in school and believed education could change him. His story is a very good testament to the strength of the Filipino people, as well as the youth who go on fighting for a better future.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">But Basilio's story can also be a caution: that education alone is a poor conditioner for actual social reform. Success on the personal scale must be accompanied by an even more gargantuan effort to rectify the injustice systematized in society. When Basilio finally finds his place in Simoun's revolution, it is with the acknowledgment that not isolated progress, but a community of action is what change would require that could make a real difference in lives.</p>

        <h3 id="basilio-legacy">4.4.4 Basilio’s Legacy: A Call to Action for the Filipino Youth</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">At the end, his journey in El Filibusterismo reaches a climax with a day of reckoning for him. With Simoun's revolution foiled and the damage that the law of violence has wrought, Basilio is left to gather the fragments of his life. Through this drama, he learns that even if radical action is necessary, it must be tempered with compassion and wisdom rather than blind vengeance.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">This message is especially important for today's Filipino youth. And that is, Basilio's legacy is one of balance or balance between personal ambition and social responsibility, between reform and revolution, and between the pursuit of education and the fight for justice. His story challenges young people to not only strive for success in their own lives but also to work for the betterment of their communities and their nation.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">Against such a background, the story of Basilio reminds one that there was no easy way about it, but it is always worthwhile in the struggle toward that better future. His strength in determination and eventual awakening to the realization that actual change happens collectively will certainly call the Filipino youth into some activism.</p>

        <h3 id="basilio-reflection">4.4.5 Reflection: Basilio’s Enduring Relevance</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">The story is that of hope and suffering, of loss and strength. He tells a tale close to the hearts of many Filipinos today, the young generation pushing through education and consequently a good life under many trials. The story of innocence turning revolution in Basilio is so close to the real lives of most young people in a world often unjust and unaccommodating.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">But more importantly, Basilio's life reminds us of personal success and a commitment to social justice in sync. His legacy is one of balance—between the pursuits of individual dreams and the broader fight for a more just and equitable society.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">So long as there are young Filipinos who dream of a better future, Basilio's spirit lives. His story aptly shows how education and resilience cannot be taken away; nor can one lose hope that change is possible in a very adverse circumstance.</p>

        <h3 id="basilio-conclusion">4.4.6 Conclusion: Basilio’s Enduring Impact on Filipino Youth</h3>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">He embodies the situations and aspirations of the youth in the Philippines. Once a son who had lost everything, he emerged as a man who wanted to shake things and bring a change within his world, and all that came along with it reflected resilience, sacrifice, and justice. Basilio is also a huge icon, and it shows through beliefs and hard work-education; real change may be brought about by collective action.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify; line-height: 2;">For the Filipino people, especially the youth, Basilio's story reminds all that the fight for a better tomorrow will never be a personal fight alone but a fight for the soul of the nation. And while there are those still willing to fight for that cause, the soul of Basilio lives on.</p>
